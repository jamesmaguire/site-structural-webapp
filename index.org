* Description
This is a website that solves simple structural engineering design problems. There is no warranty of correctness of these applications and results should be checked by by an experienced engineer.

* Usage
Input boxes that look like @@html:<input value="this" readonly></input>@@ are design inputs. Once an input is changed, the indicator on the top right of the page will show that the analysis must be re-run. To run the analysis press =ENTER= in any of the input fields.

* Todos                                                            :noexport:
** TODO Page: second moment of area
** TODO Page: Geo properties
** TODO Page: beam bending formulae
** DONE Page: RC beam moment capacity (+ drawing)
** TODO Search/filter header
** DONE Fix sub/super scripts
** DONE Update header css
** DONE Create output textbox
** DONE Update RC beam and add min strength check
** DONE Update page when input box is unfocused
** TODO Create canvas.js page with helpers
- rebar function
- roundedrect function
** TODO Add input calculations to text box
(Type 1000/200 in input and gives 5)
